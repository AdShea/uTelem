This is a simple telemetry server used by UMNSVP for the 2008 North American
Solar Challenge.  It reads a telemetry packet stream (currently set up for
J1850) from a serial port, logs incoming packets with a timestamp, and listens
on a network port (8192 default) for TCP connections.  When a client connects
it is sent the packet stream in real time.  NC and egrep are really helpful
for quick and dirty viewing.
